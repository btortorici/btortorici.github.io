      <p>Love of people and service is the foundation for the accomplished work throughout Bill Tortoriciâ€™s career.
        Mission driven and process oriented, for the last 20 years Bill has thrived in the non-profit world by
        understanding and mastering the fundraising continuum from member to donor. Bill has balanced developing and
        implementing new innovations while authentically engaging a range of audiences. </p>

      <p>Bill has provided meaningful leadership for several premier membership
        based organizations; Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, IL, and Denver Zoo, located in the heart of Denver, CO. At both
        of these institutions Bill operated, increased, and retained large membership constituencies. By using
        innovative methods, Bill helped pipeline prospects to annual, major, and capital gifts while increasing mission
        awareness and exceeding revenue goals. </p>

      <p>Bill has excelled at every level of fundraising, including developing a Planned Giving program at the
        Geological Society of America (Boulder, CO.) to his present position at the Denver Schools of Science and
        Technology as a Major Gifts Officer. </p>
